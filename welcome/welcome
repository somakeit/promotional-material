Welcome to SoMakeIt, the Southampton Makerspace!

SoMakeIt is for anyone who enjoys making things! - it's run by its members who volunteer, it's not for profit, and funded only by membership subscriptions & donations. 

We have trustees who are legally responsible for the company, but all members contribute to the running and decision making. We are a Company Limited by Guarantee so there are no share holdings. We have a lot of passionate members who put lots of time into running SoMakeIt, but we are always looking for more!

We have social & kitchen area for use by members and visitors. The rest of our main space is for clean activities such as 3D printing, Electronics, Textiles, Crafting or just sitting down with your laptop. Our well equipped workshop is segregated to keep the mess and noise out of the main space.

All tools and equipment is for use by members of SoMakeIt, although health and safety policies apply in some cases. 3D Printing is charged additionally by weight, at 4 pence per gram, for members only.

Members of SoMakeIt can use the space for their own projects, group projects, or specific workshops which we regularly run. We have a group project to build a life size Dalek which we use for charity events, around fifteen people have contributed to building it so far - carrying out tasks such as wood work, metal work, 3D printing and  electronics. You can help us finish it, or start the next project!

Joining SoMakeIt

Membership to SoMakeIt is charged on a 'pay what you can afford' basis. The minimum for full membership is £5 per month, although the suggested subscription is £20 per month. We want to make SoMakeIt accessible to everyone, but remember - we are only funded by our members so we need to make ends meet as well as make SoMakeIt even better in the future with new equipment and resources!

You can sign up right away at: somakeit.org.uk/join

We have various roles levels which are subject to approval. Becoming an actual member is dependant on having set up payments which is easy to do and integrated into the members area. Please come on down to the space during the regular openings and get to know everyone!

Every established member has the opportunity to become a key holder with 24/7 access to the space.
